# Native gate integration

zt check runs native argv/profiles in zt.json. It does not install dependencies, provision browsers/services or deploy. inspect, plan and sync --plan remain read-only. check executes scripts and writes a unique evidence directory; review script contents first.

Order a frontend profile by dependencies: lint, css, typecheck, unit, build, e2e, a11y. Explicit commands handle project script names. A zero exit establishes that command's result, not inferred route/state coverage. Avoid recursive aggregate scripts; pnpm check can wrap zt check after native subchecks are mapped.

Profile entries default to required. Deliberate warn/off choices need project justification. The runner stops after a required failure/blocker, records later checks as not_run and preserves evidence. Missing browser/server is blocked/failed work. Missing declared artifact sources fail collection.

The helper exposes ztd-css, checkCss, assertAccessible, captureState and verificationArtifacts. Keep Playwright webServer/routes/projects local. Apply shared artifact paths while retaining native use settings. Include theme/import declaration sources and exact runtime variables in CSS configuration.

The helper's public release is authorized through automatic pnpm staging and owner 2FA promotion. Follow docs/frontend-tooling.md for exact registry-version installation after promotion and successful fresh-consumer verification. Preserve dependency policies and wait for release-age eligibility. CI tarballs/checksums/source SHAs support review; the first-package stage placeholder is not the release. @ztd-me/eslint@0.1.1 is published separately. Skill sync installs complete selected directories with version/hash/local-edit protection; it does not install packages or rewrite contracts.
